### Data

Tell which data we use (see the readme file) and for which purpose.

### Temperature

insert your temperature images here.  You can put three plots on a
single figure but the results will be tiny.  I recommend to use a
separate figure for each year.

comment the results.  Do the temperature patterns look reasonable?  Do
you see major differences between years?


### Precipitation

insert your precipitation images here

comment the results.  Do the precipitation patterns look reasonable?  Do
you see major differences between years?


### Note: 

you cannot do any conclusions about long-term trend based on just 3
figures.  If you are interested, you are welcome to explore long-term
trends in these data, but be sure to use more suitable methods.
